        <p>The mission of GandaAncestry is to provide an online ecosystem where people with Baganda ancestry and others interact with Baganda cultural institutions, each other and various resources to enrich their life experiences. To achieve our mission, GandaAncestry provides features and functionality available through our website www.gandaancestry.com, including our mobile and other applications, developer platform, premium services, and other information provided as part of the GandaAncestry ("Services").</p>
        <p>This document (herein called "GandaAncestry Privacy Policy" or "Privacy Policy") describes the information that may be found on GandaAncestry and how we manage it in order to protect your privacy and maintain your trust. As guiding principles for this Privacy Policy:</p>
        <p>
        1.	We do not rent, sell, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as described in this policy or as required by law.<br />
        2.	We do not share any information on your GandaAncestry profile, family tree or any other part of your account with other parties, unless compelled by law, or as necessary to enforce our User Agreement or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of GandaAncestry, its Users, and the public.<br />
        3.	We protect the information that you provide to us using industry standard protocols and technology.<br />
        
        <p>By registering to become a member of GandaAncestry (also herein called a "User"), you voluntarily and willingly agree to provide GandaAncestry certain information, including personally identifiable information, which we collect in order to provide the Services. If you have any hesitation about providing information to us and/or having your information displayed on the GandaAncestry website or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should cancel your account immediately.</p>
        
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy by means of a notice on the GandaAncestry home page so that you may access and review the changes to this document in advance of your continued use of the service. If you object to any changes, you may close your account, thereby terminating the GandaAncestry User Agreement. When you continue to the Services after notice of changes has been sent to you or published on the GandaAncestry website, you are deemed to be consenting to the changes.</p>
        
        <p>The scope of this Privacy Policy includes the following:<br />
        1.	The information we collect<br />
        2.	How we use your information<br />
        3.	Your information related preferences<br />
        4.	Changes to the Privacy Policy<br />
        5.	How to contact us.<br />
        2.	Information We Collect and How We Collect It<br />
        
        <p>We collect your personal information in the following ways:</p>
        
        <h2>2.1	Registration</h2>
        <p>To register as a GandaAncestry member and User, you must provide us the following information to create an account: name, email address, ancestry identity, country and password. This minimal amount of information is essential for you to create a GandaAncestry account. GandaAncestry may requests additional information from you as part of the registration process, which that GandaAncestry uses to enhance the quality of the Services. You acknowledge that this information is personal to you and, when you register as a GandaAncestry User, you allow GandaAncestry and others to identify you and use your information in accordance with our User Agreement.</p>
        
        <h2>2.2	Personal Profile and Family Trees Information</h2>
        <p>Once you become a User, you may build your family tree. As part of the process of building a family tree, you provide additional information to complete your GandaAncestry Personal Profile (including but not limited to, your clan, parentage, physical attributes, education, communication addresses, locations and photograph). To expand your family tree, you must provide relationship-type and personal profile information for each individual person you add the family tree. Both providing additional information about yourself beyond what is minimally required at registration and providing information about your relatives to expand your family tree are entirely up to you (optional). However, providing the additional information enables you to derive more benefit from GandaAncestry and your family network by helping you build your Baganda ancestry and leverage your family relationships and facilitating your search for Baganda cultural and community resources and information.</p>
        
        <h2>2.3	Contacts Information</h2>
        <p>In order to interact with other GandaAncestry users (including but not limited to your relatives), you may use the Services to contact those. We collect and record the names and information of people whom you attempt to contact and use that information to send your messages as well as to allow GandaAncestry to help expand your contactable population. </p>
        
        <h2>2.4	Customer Service Contacts </h2>
        <p>We collect information when you interact with GandaAncestry's customer service channels (e.g., Help Center, email, etc.) to help us to accurately categorize and respond to your inquiries and investigate possible breaches of our terms.</p>
        
        <h2>2.5	Using the GandaAncestry Site and Applications</h2>
        <p>We collect information when you interact with and use the Services. For example, we can track and record the event when you click on an ad, upload your photograph, invite a relative by email, etc.</p>
        
        <h2>2.6	Using Third Party Services and Visiting Third Party Sites </h2>
        <p>We receive record information when you use your GandaAncestry account to log in or authenticate to a third-party website or application. Also, if you are logged into GandaAncestry and visit a third party site, GandaAncestry may receive information about the pages that load in your web browser.</p>
        
        <h2>2.7	Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use cookies and log files to track site usage data, statistics and trends, for purposes of improving the quality of the Services and to manage GandaAncestry and third-party advertising to Users on and off GandaAncestry. Cookies are very small data files that we use to store information, on your computer, which allows us to recognize you as a User when you return to GandaAncestry using the same computer and web browser. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser but doing so may affect your ability to use GandaAncestry normally. </p>
        
        <h2>2.8	Advertising and Web Beacons </h2>
        <p>To support the Services, which we provide at no cost to our Users, and to provide a more relevant and useful experience for our Users, we use ad networks to target and serve online advertisements (ads). Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad exchanges, ad technology vendors and research firms.</p>
        <p>Ads are targeted using information derived from user profiles and family trees based on personal profile categories (e.g., "Female members of the Mmamba clan") or on non-personally identifiable information inferred from a User account and personal profile (e.g., gender, nationality, or other aspects of your life) in addition to a User's use of GandaAncestry or their clicking on GandaAncestry ad inventory. GandaAncestry does not provide personally identifiable information to any third party ad network.</p>
        
        <h2>2.9	Computer and Mobile Device Addresses and Information</h2>
        <p>Based on Internet communications standards, whenever you visit the GandaAncestry website we automatically receive the Internet address ("URL") of the site from which you came. Similarly we receive the URL of the site to which you are going when you leave GandaAncestry. Also, advertisers receive the URL of the GandaAncestry web page where you clicked on an ad. GandaAncestry also receives the internet protocol ("IP") address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the Internet), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, your mobile device (including your device Unique Device Identifier or UDID) and mobile operating system, if you access GandaAncestry using a mobile device, plus the name of your ISP or your mobile service carrier. GandaAncestry does not share your IP address and personally identifiable information in your profile or family tree with third parties without your permission, except as described in Section 3.9 ("Compliance with Legal Process"), below.</p>
        
        <h2>2.10	Rights to Access, Correct and Eliminate Information about You</h2>

You may request deletion of your information at any time by contacting GandaAncestry customer service through the Help Center pages. We will respond to your request within 30 days.

        <p>Communications that you initiate through GandaAncestry (e.g., an invitation sent to a non-User) may display your primary email address and name. Communications you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your family tree and other connections (for instance how many people are in your family tree), but will not display the people to whom you are directly connected.

        <h2>3.6	Polls and Surveys</h2>
        <p>GandaAncestry may conduct polls or surveys, directly or using third parties, whereby you are invited, as a User, to participate.

Whether or not you decide to participate in a poll or survey is completely up to you.</p>
        <p>After you complete a poll, you will be given access to the aggregate responses of the poll on a results page. GandaAncestry or third parties may target advertisements to you on the results page based on your answers in the poll.</p>
        <p>We will not disclose any personally identifiable information to any third parties in connection with the conduct of any polls or surveys.</p> 
        
        <h2>3.7	Search</h2>
        <p>GandaAncestry search services enable a User to find information about members of his or her family tree, the Kabaka, other GandaAncestry Users, other Baganda, Baganda cultural institutions and other facets of the Buganda kingdom. We use information from User profiles and family tries, and relationships to Baganda institutions (e.g., clans, sub-clan groups, ssaza, etc.) to inform and refine our search service. Also, when a User uses the "Searcher Baganda" feature, we may display the name and clan for you and other members of you family tree.</p>
        
        <h2>3.8	Testimonials and Advertisements on GandaAncestry </h2>
        <p>If you post any testimonials about the Services on GandaAncestry or place advertisements through the GandaAncestry Ads, we may include those testimonials and examples of advertisements you placed in in our promotions of the Services to third parties.</p> 
        
        <h2>3.9	Compliance with Legal Process </h2>
        <p>GandaAncestry may be required to disclose personal information, profile and family information and/or information about your activities as a GandaAncestry User when required by subpoena or other legal process, or if GandaAncestry has a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (a) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (b) to enforce the User Agreement, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property or personal safety of GandaAncestry, our Users, employees, or others.</p>
        
        <h2>4.	Your Information Preferences</h2>
        
        <h2>4.1	Managing Your Account Information</h2>
        <p>You can review the personal information you provided to us and make any desired changes to the information you publish, or to the settings for your GandaAncestry account including your email and contact preferences, at any time by logging in to your account on the GandaAncestry website. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, GandaAncestry may retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its databases.</p>
        
        <h2>4.2	Default Account and Privacy Settings</h2>
        <p>GandaAncestry has established what we believe to be reasonable default privacy, communications, surveys and other settings that we have found most users to find desirable ("Default Settings"). Because Users may interact with GandaAncestry in a variety of ways, and because those interactions may change over time, we designed GandaAncestry to provide Users with granular control over the information they share. Please carefully review your Default Settings and adjust them to meet your personal preferences.</p>
        
        <h2>4.3	Closing Your Account</h2>
        <p>You can close your account through the "Account Settings" tab on your GandaAncestry profile page. If you close your GandaAncestry account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable databases. When you close your account, we have no obligation to retain your information, and may delete any or all of your account information without liability. However, we may retain certain data contributed by you if GandaAncestry believes that such information may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. GandaAncestry may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Users. GandaAncestry disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. Similarly, we are not liable for continued display of your publically viewable information by search engines (e.g., Google, Yahoo, etc.) after you close your GandaAncestry account.</p>
        
        <h2>4.4	Memorializing Accounts</h2>
        <p>If we learn that a User is deceased, we may memorialize the User's account. In these cases we may restrict profile access, remove messaging functionality, and close an account if we receive a formal request from the User's next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.</p>
        
        <h2>5.	Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time, with or without advance notice. When we make significant changes in the way we treat your personally identifiable information, or in the Privacy Policy document itself, we will display a notice on the GandaAncestry website or send you an email, so that you may review the changed terms prior to continuing to use the Services.</p> 
        <p>Using the GandaAncestry Services after a notice of changes has been sent to you or published on our site shall constitute consent to the changed terms or practices.</p>
